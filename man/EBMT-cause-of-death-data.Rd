\description{
A data frame of 8966 patients transplanted at the EBMT. The included
variables are \describe{ \item{id}{Patient identification number}
\item{time}{Time in months from transplantation to death or last follow-up}
\item{status}{Survival status; 0 = censored; 1,...,6 = death due to the
following causes: Relapse (1), GvHD (2), Bacterial infections (3), Viral
infections (4), Fungal infections (5), Other causes (6)} \item{cod}{Cause of
death as factor with levels "Alive", "Relapse", "GvHD", "Bacterial",
"Viral", "Fungal", "Other"} \item{dissub}{Disease subclassification; factor
with levels "AML", "ALL", "CML"} \item{match}{Donor-recipient gender match;
factor with levels "No gender mismatch", "Gender mismatch"}
\item{tcd}{T-cell depletion; factor with levels "No TCD", "TCD", "Unknown"}
\item{year}{Year of transplantation; factor with levels "1985-1989",
"1990-1994", "1995-1998"} \item{age}{Patient age at transplant; factor with
levels "<=20", "20-40", ">40"} }
