\title{Compute subject-specific transition hazards with (co-)variances}
\usage{
msfit(
  object,
  newdata,
  variance = TRUE,
  vartype = c("aalen", "greenwood"),
  trans
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{\link[survival:coxph]{coxph}} object describing the
fit of the multi-state model}

\item{newdata}{A data frame with the same variable names as those that
appear in the \code{coxph} formula. Its use is somewhat different from
\code{\link[survival:survfit]{survfit}}. See Details.  The argument
\code{newdata} may be omitted only if the right hand side of the formula in
the \code{coxph} object is \code{~strata(trans)}}

\item{variance}{A logical value indicating whether the (co-)variances of the
subject-specific transition hazards should be computed. Default is
\code{TRUE}}

\item{vartype}{A character string specifying the type of variances to be
computed (so only needed if \code{variance}=\code{TRUE}).  Possible values
are \code{"aalen"} or \code{"greenwood"}}

\item{trans}{Transition matrix describing the states and transitions in the
multi-state model. See \code{trans} in \code{\link{msprep}} for more
detailed information}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"msfit"}, which is a list containing
\item{Haz }{A data frame with \code{time}, \code{Haz}, \code{trans},
containing the estimated subject-specific hazards for each of the
transitions in the multi-state model} \item{varHaz }{A data frame with
\code{time}, \code{Haz}, \code{trans1}, \code{trans2} containing the
variances (\code{trans1}=\code{trans2}) and covariances
(\code{trans1}<\code{trans2}) of the estimated hazards. This element is only
returned when \code{variance}=\code{TRUE}} \item{trans}{The transition
matrix used}
}
\description{
This function computes subject-specific or overall cumulative transition
hazards for each of the possible transitions in the multi-state model. If
requested, also the variances and covariances of the estimated cumulative
transition hazards are calculated.
}
\details{
The data frame needs to have one row for each transition in the multi-state
model. An additional column \code{strata} (numeric) is needed to describe
for each transition to which stratum it belongs. The name has to be
\code{strata}, even if in the original \code{coxph} call another variable
was used. For details refer to de Wreede, Fiocco & Putter (2010). So far,
the results have been checked only for the \code{"breslow"} method of
dealing with ties in \code{\link[survival:coxph]{coxph}}, so this is
recommended.
