\description{
These data sets give the times (in years) from HIV infection to AIDS, SI
switch and death in 329 men who have sex with men (MSM). Data are from the
period until combination anti-retroviral therapy became available (1996).
For more background information on the cohort, ccr5 and SI, see Geskus
\emph{et al.} (2000, 2003)

\details{
\code{aidssi} contains follow-up data until the first of AIDS and SI switch.
It was used as example for the competing risks analyses in Putter, Fiocco,
Geskus (2007) and in Geskus (2016).

\code{aidssi2} extends the \code{aidssi} data set in three ways. First, it
considers events after the initial one. Second, it includes the entry times
of the individuals that entered the study after HIV infection. Third, age at
HIV infection has been added as extra covariable. Numbers differ slightly
from the \code{aidssi} data set. Some individuals were diagnosed with AIDS
only when they died and others had their last follow-up at AIDS diagnosis.
In order to prevent two transitions to happen at the same time, their time
to AIDS was shortened by 0.25 years. This data set was used as example for
the multi-state analyses in Geskus (2016).
