\title{Cut a multi-state data set at a landmark time point}
\usage{
cutLMms(msdata, LM, cens)
}
\arguments{
\item{msdata}{An object of class \code{"msdata"}, such as output by
\code{\link{msprep}}}

\item{LM}{The landmark time point at which the cut is to be made}

\item{cens}{The time point at which administrative censoring is to be
applied; if missing, no administrative censoring will be applied}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"msdata"} again, containing only follow-up
data after LM. The data frame contains an extra column \code{Tentry} with
the time of entry into the present state.
}
\description{
Given a dataset in long format, for instance generated by
\code{\link{msprep}}, this function cuts a multi-state data frame (object of
type "msdata") at a landmark time point LM. Administrative censoring can be
applied at time \code{cens}, equal for all individuals.
}
\details{
The function has a similar purpose as the \code{cutLM} function in the
\code{dynpred} package. Only follow-up after a landmark time point LM is
considered, so all subjects who are no longer at risk are removed. Column
\code{time} is updated based on the new Tstart and Tstop.

tmat <- trans.illdeath(names=c("Tx","PR","RelDeath"))
data(ebmt3) # data from Section 4 of Putter, Fiocco & Geskus (2007)
msebmt <- msprep(time=c(NA,"prtime","rfstime"),status=c(NA,"prstat","rfsstat"),
		data=ebmt3,trans=tmat)
# Cut at 5 years
cutLMms(msebmt, LM=1826)
events(cutLMms(msebmt, LM=1826))
