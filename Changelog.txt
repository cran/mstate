Version 0.2.4 (2010-05-12)
- The ebmt4 dataset has been adapted; recovery and adverse event are abstracted.
  Simultaneous occurrences of recovery and adverse events are removed; these
  have been adapted so that recoveries occur half a day earlier. Also simultaneous
  relapse and death have been set to relapse, the death status has been set to 0.
  A new variable recae has been created, defined as the time at which both recovery
  and AE have been obtained. The corresponding status variable recae.s
  is only 1 in case the patient has experienced both recovery and AE.
- In probtrans, the argument direction now can take the values of "forward" and
  "fixedhorizon". The option "fixedhorizon" was previously called "backward".
- In the summary method for probtrans, a bug has beeen fixed. This summary used
  to show head and again head, this has been changed to head and tail.
- In msfit, the newdata argument is now first sorted according to trans
- The function redrank now asks for two formulas, rather than two character strings
  containing column names in the data for reduced rank and full covariates
- xlim has been added as explicit argument to plot.probtrans
- Error fixed in handling last time point in msfit

Version 0.2.3 (2009-11-06)

- The results of calls to msfit and probtrans are now 'msfit' and 'probtrans'
  S3 objects
- Plot and summary methods for 'msfit' and 'probtrans' objects have been added
- The result of call to msprep is now an 'msdata' S3 object
- The first argument of expand.covs and the result of a call to expand.covs
  is now an 'msdata' object
- A print method for 'msdata' objects has been added
- A convenient function, transMat, to define transition matrices, kindly
  provided by Steven McKinney, has been added

Version 0.2.2 (2009-09-15)

- Changed a small error in the vignette on page 9, where the written text was
  incompatible with the R output of c3
- mstate had a call to "model.newframe" in msfit from the survival package,
  which was removed in R version 2.9.2. In msfit,
  survival:::model.newframe(Terms, newdata, response=FALSE) has been replaced by
  model.frame(delete.response(Terms), newdata, xlev=object$xlevels)
- Replaced the example in redrank by a much shorter one, the original is now
  only mentioned in \dontrun{}


Version 0.2.1 (2009-07-10)

- Added vignette showing how to do the analyses of Putter H, Fiocco M,
  Geskus RB (2007). Tutorial in biostatistics: Competing risks and multi-state
  models. Statistics in Medicine 26, 2389-2430. Usage: vignette("Tutorial")
- Changed name of cuminc to Cuminc to avoid confusion with the cuminc function
  of cmprsk
- Repaired bug in Cuminc that caused error when no events of certain cause
  were present
- Repaired bug in Cuminc that caused error when only single cause of failure
  was present
- Added option longnames to expand.covs to have the possibility of shorter
  covariate names
- Implemented "aalen" option in msfit for models without covariates
- Implemented "efron" method for ties in msfit; the coxph object that is used
  as input for msfit may have used either "breslow" or "efron" as method for
  ties. Previously only "breslow" was possible.
