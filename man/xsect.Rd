\title{Make a cross-section of multi-state data at a given time point}
\usage{
xsect(msdata, xtime = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{msdata}{An object of class \code{"msdata"}, such as output by
\code{\link{msprep}}}

\item{xtime}{The time point at which the intersection is to be made}
}
\value{
A list containing \code{idstate}, a data frame containing
\code{id}'s and \code{state}, the number of the state currently occupied;
\code{atrisk}, the number at risk, and \code{prop}, a table counting how
many of those at risk occupy which state.
}
\description{
Given a dataset in long format, for instance generated by
\code{\link{msprep}}, this function takes a cross-section at a given time
point, to list the subjects under observation (at risk) at that time point
and the states currently occupied.
}
\details{
It is possible that subjects have moved to one of the absorbing states prior
to \code{xtime}; this is NOT taken into account. The function \code{xsect}
only concerns subjects currently (at \code{time}) at risk.
}
\examples{

tmat <- trans.illdeath(names=c("Tx","PR","RelDeath"))
data(ebmt3) # data from Section 4 of Putter, Fiocco & Geskus (2007)
msebmt <- msprep(time=c(NA,"prtime","rfstime"),status=c(NA,"prstat","rfsstat"),
		data=ebmt3,trans=tmat)
# At the start everyone is in state 1 (default xtime=0 is used)
xsect(msebmt)
# At 5 years
xsect(msebmt, xtime=1826)
