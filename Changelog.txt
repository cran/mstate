Version 0.2.2 (2009-09-15)
- Changed a small error in the vignette on page 9, where the written text was
  incompatible with the R output of c3
- mstate had a call to "model.newframe" in msfit from the survival package,
  which was removed in R version 2.9.2. In msfit,
  survival:::model.newframe(Terms, newdata, response=FALSE) has been replaced by
  model.frame(delete.response(Terms), newdata, xlev=object$xlevels)
- Replaced the example in redrank by a much shorter one, the original is now
  only mentioned in \dontrun{}


Version 0.2.1 (2009-07-10)

- Added vignette showing how to do the analyses of Putter H, Fiocco M,
  Geskus RB (2007). Tutorial in biostatistics: Competing risks and multi-state
  models. Statistics in Medicine 26, 2389-2430. Usage: vignette("Tutorial")
- Changed name of cuminc to Cuminc to avoid confusion with the cuminc function
  of cmprsk
- Repaired bug in Cuminc that caused error when no events of certain cause
  were present
- Repaired bug in Cuminc that caused error when only single cause of failure
  was present
- Added option longnames to expand.covs to have the possibility of shorter
  covariate names
- Implemented "aalen" option in msfit for models without covariates
- Implemented "efron" method for ties in msfit; the coxph object that is used
  as input for msfit may have used either "breslow" or "efron" as method for
  ties. Previously only "breslow" was possible.
