\title{Find all possible trajectories through a given multi-state model}
\usage{
paths(trans, start = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{trans}{The transition matrix describing the multi-state model, see
\code{\link{msprep}}}

\item{start}{The starting state for the trajectories}
}
\value{
A matrix, each row of which specifies a possible path through the
multi-state model.
}
\description{
For a given multi-state model, specified through a transition matrix,
\code{paths} recursively finds all the possible trajectories or paths
through that multi-state starting from a specified state. DO NOT USE for
reversible or cyclic multi-state models.
}
\details{
The function is recursive. It starts in \code{start}, looks at what states
can be visited from \code{start}, and appends the results of the next call
to the current value (matrix). If the transition matrix contains loops, the
function will find infinitely many paths, so do not use \code{paths} for
reversible or cyclic multi-state models. A warning is not yet incorporated!
