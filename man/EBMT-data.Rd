We acknowledge the European Society for Blood and Marrow
Transplantation (EBMT) for making available these data. Disclaimer: these
data were simplified for the purpose of illustration of the analysis of
competing risks and multi-state models and do not reflect any real life
situation. No clinical conclusions should be drawn from these data.

\description{
A data frame of 2279 patients transplanted at the EBMT between 1985 and
1998. These data were used in Fiocco, Putter & van Houwelingen (2008), van
Houwelingen & Putter (2008, 2012) and de Wreede, Fiocco & Putter (2011). The
included variables are \describe{ \item{id}{Patient identification number}
\item{rec}{Time in days from transplantation to recovery or last follow-up}
\item{rec.s}{Recovery status; 1 = recovery, 0 = censored} \item{ae}{Time in
days from transplantation to adverse event (AE) or last follow-up}
\item{ae.s}{Adverse event status; 1 = adverse event, 0 = censored}
\item{recae}{Time in days from transplantation to both recovery and AE or
last follow-up} \item{recae.s}{Recovery and AE status; 1 = both recovery and
AE, 0 = no recovery or no AE or censored} \item{rel}{Time in days from
transplantation to relapse or last follow-up} \item{rel.s}{Relapse status; 1
= relapse, 0 = censored} \item{srv}{Time in days from transplantation to
death or last follow-up} \item{srv.s}{Relapse status; 1 = dead, 0 =
censored} \item{year}{Year of transplantation; factor with levels
"1985-1989", "1990-1994", "1995-1998"} \item{agecl}{Patient age at
transplant; factor with levels "<=20", "20-40", ">40"}
\item{proph}{Prophylaxis; factor with levels "no", "yes"}
\item{match}{Donor-recipient gender match; factor with levels "no gender
mismatch", "gender mismatch"} }
